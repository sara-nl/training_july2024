We will finish the training with a small hands-on exercise on Research Drive: after creating/uploading dummy data to your project space, you will use a new beta RD functionality to automatically upload your dataset to a Data Repository of your choice.

To login to Research Drive, go to https://demo.data.surfsara.nl/

There are 30 demo accounts named **DemoX** (where X is 1 to 30) with password **RD_Demo_bNu7**

Each account has a project folder called Data DemoX

[Upload data](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Hands-On+for+Introduction+to+SURF+Research+Cloud) to your project folder:

- [RD web interface](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Reseach+Drive+web+interface)
- [rclone](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Access+Research+Drive+via+Rclone)
- [OwnCloud](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/ownCloud+desktop+client)

then follow these instructions: https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102828271#SurfResearchDataConnector(pilot)-Gettingstarted
to connect to a Data Repository and upload your dataset directly from Research Drive.
